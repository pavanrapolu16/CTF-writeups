# 🛡️ CTF Writeups by Sthara

Welcome to my Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups repository!  
Here, I document the CTF challenges I’ve solved — focusing on the **approach**, **techniques**, and **exploitation** process used.

## 📚 Why This Repo?

- 🧠 To reinforce my understanding by explaining the challenge step-by-step.
- 🧪 To share knowledge with fellow security enthusiasts.
- 💼 To showcase my practical skills in cybersecurity and problem solving.

## 📂 Structure

Each folder is organized by CTF platform and year. Inside each challenge writeup, you’ll find:

- Challenge description
- Vulnerability or concept
- Exploitation steps
- Code snippets
- Tools used
- Flag (if public CTF)
